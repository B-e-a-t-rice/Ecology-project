I conducted data analysis and statistics as part of a research group within the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research. This ecology project had two main goals: to manipulate the emergence timing of several Colorado native grasses and to observe any unexpected effects on the plants caused by manipulations to the time of emergence. 

I conducted my analysis in R, which I've shared in this repository. I performed exploratory data analysis through visualizations with ggplot, and statistical tests such as regression analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA).
